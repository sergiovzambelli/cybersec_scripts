'''
Block class with a nonce that increments by 1 during the mining process.

The mining process involves generating a hash for the block and comparing the first 
`len(difficulty)` characters of the hash with the given difficulty level. 
The process continues until the hash satisfies the difficulty condition.

Utility functions to save and load the state of the mining process.

These functions manage the persistence of the current state in a JSON file. 
The state includes the current difficulty level and trial, allowing the program

'''
This program is designed to analyze and collect statistics on how computational time increases 
with the difficulty level during the mining process. The results are recorded in a CSV file 
for analysis. 

To allow for non-continuous execution of the script, the program saves the current state of 
the mining process in a JSON file. This state includes the last difficulty level and trial 
completed, enabling the script to resume from where it left off when executed again.
